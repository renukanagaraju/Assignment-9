1. If Z is norm (mean = 0, sd = 1)
Find P(Z > 2.64)
Answer:
      Pnorm(2.64, lower.tail=FALSE)
      pnorm(2.64, lower.tail = FALSE)
      [1] 0.004145301

Find P(|Z| > 1.39)
Answer :
      2*pnorm(-1.39)
      2 * pnorm(-1.39)
      [1] 0.1645289



2. Suppose p = the proportion of students who are admitted to the graduate school of the University of
California at Berkeley, and suppose that a public relation officer boasts that UCB has historically had a
40% acceptance rate for its graduate school. Consider the data stored in the table UCBAdmissions from
1973. Assuming these observations constituted a simple random sample, are they consistent with the
officerâ..s claim, or do they provide evidence that the acceptance rate was significantly less than 40%?
Use an Î± = 0.01 significance level.
Answer:
          Our null hypothesis in this problem is H0 : p = 0.4 and the alternative hypothesis is H1 : p < 0.4. We reject the null hypothesis if ˆp is too small, that is, if
           pˆ − 0.4 √ 0.4(1 − 0.4)/n < −zα,
           where α = 0.01 and −z0.01 is

Our test statistic is not less than −2.32, so it does not fall into the critical region. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the true proportion of students admitted to graduate school is less than 40% and say that the observed data are consistent with the officer’s claim at the α = 0.01 significance level.

          X <- data.frame(UCBAdmissions)
          Admitted <- X$Admit
          Freq <- X$Freq

          # From the question, the value of p0 is 0.4. 
          # Sample proportion = (# of admitted)/Total
          p0 = 0.4
          Adm <- grep("Admitted", Admitted)
          Adm
          Adm1 = NULL
          for(i in Adm)
          {
           X <- Freq[i]
           Adm1 = rbind(Adm1, X)
          }
          no.adm <- sum(Adm1)   # number of students admitted 
          Total <- sum(Freq) # total students
          p_hat = no.adm / Total  # Sample proportion

          # Test statistic
          z = (p_hat - p0) / round(sqrt((p0*(1-p0))/Total),8)
          z
          prob = pnorm(z, 0, 1)
          prob

# The probability value obtained is 0.04638927, which is greater than 0.01. Therefore
# we can conclude that the acceptance range is consistent with the officer's claim.
